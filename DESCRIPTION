Description: Allows accessing Docker SDK from R via the Docker Python SDK using the 'reticulate' package.
  This is a very thin wrapper that tries to do very little and get out of the way.
  The user is expected to know how to use the reticulate package to access Python modules, and how the Docker Python SDK works.
